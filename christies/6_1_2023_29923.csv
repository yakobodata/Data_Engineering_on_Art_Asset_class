Hailing from a prominent Suzhou family he learned from the art of Shen Zhou (1427-1509) and Wen Zhengming (1470-1559) in his early years. His later intimate studies of branches and flowers fully inspired by nature are brilliant performances in brush and ink and penetrating portraits of the subjects. For Chen Chun painting is an act of ink play from the heart. Together with Xu Wei (1521-1593) his expressionistic individualism transformed flower paintings for generations of artists that followed. <br>,In the spring of 1539 while in the mood for wine the fifty-six-year-old Chen Chun painted Flowers and Calligraphy on a boat in Suzhou. Measuring over four metres long it depicts peony magnolia orchid chrysanthemum narcissus and camellia each section separated by five-character quatrains inscribed by the artist. The colophon concludes that he painted the scroll in such an inebriated state that he could &#8216;no longer tell the beautiful from the ugly&#8217;. The ethereal flowers and branches are laid out with light ink then meticulously outlined their colouristic beauty demonstrating the artist&#8217;s superb command of ink and wash. Li Ruiqing (1867-1920) praised the otherworldliness of Chen Chun&#8217;s brushstrokes in the frontispiece: &#8216;viewing this painting in summertime makes one feel like tasting ice and snow under plum blossoms.&#8217;<br>,During the Kangxi period Flowers and Calligraphy was in the collection of Wang Wenbo (1659-1725) a great book collector in Tongxiang. In late Qing it was collected by the connoisseur Chen Jide. In 1918 Zeng Xi (1861-1930) inscribed the titleslip followed by a long colophon by Wu Changshuo (1844-1927) dated June of the same year. It also bears the collector&#8217;s seals of Madame Xu Wenbo wife of Zhang Daqian further adding to its illustrious provenance.<br>,"

A prominent court official he served as the keeper of the imperial collection and often accompanied Kangxi in viewings. It is recorded that the Emperor also enjoyed observing him during the act of painting.<br>,Painted from spring to winter over the course of 1708 Landscape after Song and Yuan Masters dates to the height of artist&#8217;s late period as Wang Yuanqi notes in his colophon in the quiet moments during his service at the Changchun Garden. Each leaf interprets the style of an earlier artist including Wu Zhen Lu Hong Dong Yuan Wang Meng Huang Gongwang Ni Zan Mi Youren Cao Zhibai Li Cheng Ju Ran and Guo Xi. Reducing the artists&#8217; schema to abstract geometric forms his brushwork is assured and confident undoubtedly benefitting from the rare experience of viewing calligraphy and paintings in imperial collection for many years.<br>,1708 was also the year Paintings and Calligraphy in Peiwen Studio the compilation of the imperial collection which Wang Yuanqi presided over and supervised was completed. In the colophon of Landscape after Song and Yuan Masters he proposes that learning from the style of the masters should not be limited to mere imitation. Drawing inspiration from the masters of the Song and Yuan dynasties the present album is a testament to the artist&#8217;s wish to &#8216;express my own perspective&#8217;. Also of note is that each leaf bears a different artist&#8217;s seal with no repetition suggesting that Wang Yuanqi took particular care in completing the album. The album was collected by collectors including Wu Weiguang (1743-1803) and Miao Qi (1821-1885).<br>,"
